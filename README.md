# Solutions and Explanations for Neetcode 150 ðŸš€

This repository contains solutions (with explanations) to the 150 coding interview questions from the popular [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) platform. These solutions are implemented in Python and cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms commonly asked in coding interviews. The repo will be periodically updated with new solutions!

## Purpose

This repository provides a comprehensive resource for anyone preparing for SWE/SDE coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills. These solutions can help you gain a better understanding of various data structures and algorithms, as well as practice implementing efficient and optimized solutions. The questions are organized in [`QUESTIONS.md`](QUESTIONS.md)

<br>

<i><b>Tip:</b> Use this repository as a reference after making an honest attempt, and compare your solution to identify areas for improvement. Trying to solve the problems yourself will help you develop your problem-solving ability.</i>
