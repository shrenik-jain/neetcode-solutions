# Solutions (with explanations) for Neetcode 150 ðŸš€

This repository contains solutions (with explanations) to the 150 coding interview questions from the popular [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) platform. These solutions are implemented in Python and cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms commonly asked in coding interviews.

The repo will be periodically updated with new solutions!

## Purpose

This repository provides a comprehensive resource for anyone preparing for SWE/SDE coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills. These solutions can help you gain a better understanding of various data structures and algorithms, as well as practice implementing efficient and optimized solutions.

<i><b>Tip:</b> Before diving into the solutions, I recommend that you first try solving the problems yourself. This will help you develop your problem-solving ability. Use this repository as a reference after making an honest attempt, and compare your solution with the provided ones to identify areas for improvement. </i>

The questions are organized in [`QUESTIONS.md`](QUESTIONS.md)
