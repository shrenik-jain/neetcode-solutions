# Explanatory Solutions for NeetCode 150 ðŸš€

This repository contains explanatory solutions to the 150 coding interview questions from the popular [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/) platform. These solutions are implemented in Python and cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms commonly asked in coding interviews.

The site will periodically be updated with new solutions from this repo!

## What is NeetCode 150?

NeetCode 150 is a meticulously curated set of 150 LeetCode problems covering all essential data structure and algorithm topics, making it an indispensable resource for preparing for coding interviews at top tech companies like FAANG.

Creator's [original repository](https://github.com/neetcode-gh/leetcode) and [website](https://neetcode.io/).

## How to Use

<i><b>Tip:</b> Before diving into the solutions, I recommend that you first try solving the problems yourself. This practice will help you develop your problem-solving skills. Use this repository as a reference after making an honest attempt, and compare your solution with the provided ones to identify areas for improvement. </i>


1. Navigate to the specific folder containing the solutions you want to study.
2. Open the Python file(s) and read through the code, comments, and explanations.
3. Feel free to modify the solutions, experiment with different approaches, or add your own solutions to the repository. (To contribute, see [here](#contributing))

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders, each containing solutions for a specific data structure or algorithm topic. Each folder contains Python files with solutions to the respective NeetCode questions (organized in [`QUESTIONS.md`](QUESTIONS.md)), along with explanations and comments to help you understand the approach and thought process behind each solution.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills in Python. By studying these solutions, you can gain a better understanding of various data structures and algorithms, as well as practice implementing efficient and optimized solutions to common coding problems.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! Solutions are also welcome for any other supported language on leetcode. If you have an alternative solution, an optimization, or a new question to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b new-solution`.
3. Make the necessary changes and commit them: `git commit -am 'Add some solution'`.
4. Push the changes to your forked repository: `git push origin new-solution`.
5. Submit a pull request detailing your changes.

    ### <u>Guidelines</u>

    - Make sure your code passes all the test cases on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for the problem it solves.
    - Write clean code that is easy to understand.
